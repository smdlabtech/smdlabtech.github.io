### Here's a little story :
I was captivated by Denzel Washington's masterful portrayal of Robert McCall, embodying a solitary avenger in an unjust world, which struck a deep chord within me. The film's intense action sequences and the overarching theme of fighting against injustice not only kept me on the edge of my seat but also left a lasting impression of satisfaction and inspiration.  

So why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Equalizer_(film)) and it will answer **all** your questions.
