## 🚀 Introduction

In this post, we'll explore how to build an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline by combining several key technologies:

* **Smart ingestion** with cleaning, chunking, and metadata enrichment.
* **Embedding generation** to represent documents in a vector space.
* **Vector indexing** using **Qdrant**, a high-performance vector database.
* **Advanced metadata filtering** to refine search results.
* **Prompt enhancement** to better guide language models.
* **Orchestrated retrieval agents** for contextual and relevant information retrieval.

---

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Ingestion

The first step is to prepare the data:

* **Cleaning**: removing special characters, HTML tags, etc.
* **Chunking**: splitting documents into appropriately sized segments.
* **Metadata enrichment**: adding contextual information like source, date, author, etc.

These metadata are crucial for advanced filtering during retrieval.

---

## 🧠 Step 2: Embedding Generation

Text segments are transformed into numeric vectors (embeddings) using language models such as:

* **OpenAI**
* **Cohere**
* **Hugging Face Transformers**

These vectors capture semantic meaning and enable similarity-based search.

---

## 📃 Step 3: Indexing with Qdrant

Embeddings are stored in **Qdrant**, a performant vector database offering:

* **Fast vector search**
* **Metadata-based filtering**
* **Hybrid search support**

Qdrant enables effective searches combining vector similarity and metadata filters.

---

## 🔍 Step 4: Advanced Metadata Filtering

Metadata filtering restricts search results based on specific criteria.

For example, to search for documents in the "laptop" category with price <= 1000:

```json
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {
        "key": "category",
        "match": { "value": "laptop" }
      },
      {
        "key": "price",
        "range": {
          "lte": 1000
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3,
  "with_payload": true,
  "with_vector": false
}
```

This filtering improves result accuracy and reduces computational load.

---

## 🧪 Step 5: Prompt Enhancement

Prompt enhancement involves guiding the language model for more relevant answers.

Techniques used:

* **Few-shot prompting**: include examples in the prompt.
* **Chain-of-thought prompting**: encourage step-by-step reasoning.
* **Self-ask prompting**: let the model pose intermediate questions.

These techniques boost response quality.

---

## 🤖 Step 6: Orchestrated Retrieval Agents

Orchestrated agents coordinate various pipeline steps to deliver contextual answers:

1. **Query analysis**
2. **Search in Qdrant with metadata filtering**
3. **Retrieve relevant documents**
4. **Generate the answer using a language model**

This orchestration ensures efficient and relevant information retrieval.

---

## 📈 Results and Performance

Using Qdrant with metadata filtering and hybrid search offers:

* **Improved result accuracy**
* **Faster response times**
* **Scalability for large datasets**

---

## 🧹 Example Code with LlamaIndex and Qdrant

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.qdrant import QdrantVectorStore
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_data")

vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    "my_collection", client=client, enable_hybrid=True, batch_size=20
)

storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
    documents,
    storage_context=storage_context,
)
```

This code builds a hybrid index combining dense and sparse search.

---

## 🧹 Conclusion

By combining smart ingestion, embeddings, Qdrant vector indexing, advanced metadata filtering, prompt enhancement, and orchestrated retrieval agents, you can build a high-performance and scalable RAG pipeline.

These techniques enable precise and contextual responses, essential for modern AI applications.
