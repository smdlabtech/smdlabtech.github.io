## 🚀 Introduction

In this post, we'll explore how to build an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline by combining several key technologies:

* 🧹 **Smart ingestion**: cleaning, chunking, and metadata enrichment.
* 🧠 **Embedding generation**: turning documents into vector representations.
* 🗃️ **Vector indexing**: using **Qdrant** for high-performance retrieval.
* 🧾 **Advanced metadata filtering**: refining search results.
* 🧪 **Prompt enhancement**: guiding language models effectively.
* 🤖 **Orchestrated retrieval agents**: coordinating the pipeline efficiently.

## 🧹 Step 1: Data Ingestion

Prepare your data with:

* **Cleaning**: Remove special characters, HTML, etc.
* **Chunking**: Split into manageable text segments.
* **Metadata enrichment**: Add source, date, author, etc.

Metadata are key for enabling powerful search filters.

## 🧠 Step 2: Embedding Generation

Convert text into vector format using:

* OpenAI
* Cohere
* Hugging Face Transformers

These embeddings allow semantic search based on meaning.

## 📃 Step 3: Indexing with Qdrant

Use **Qdrant** for fast and scalable vector searches. It supports:

* ⚡ High-speed indexing
* 🎯 Metadata filtering
* 🔀 Hybrid search (semantic + keyword)

## 🔍 Step 4: Advanced Metadata Filtering

Filter results with JSON-based queries. For example:

```json
{
  "vector": [0.2, 0.1, 0.9, 0.7],
  "filter": {
    "must": [
      {"key": "category", "match": {"value": "laptop"}},
      {"key": "price", "range": {"lte": 1000}}
    ]
  },
  "limit": 3,
  "with_payload": true,
  "with_vector": false
}
```

## 🧪 Step 5: Prompt Enhancement

Improve response relevance with techniques like:

* 📘 Few-shot prompting
* 🧠 Chain-of-thought
* ❓ Self-ask prompting

These help guide models toward better answers.

## 🤖 Step 6: Orchestrated Retrieval Agents

Agents automate the RAG pipeline:

1. Query analysis
2. Vector + metadata search in Qdrant
3. Document retrieval
4. LLM-based answer generation

## 📈 Results and Performance

Benefits of this setup:

* 🎯 Higher accuracy
* 🚀 Faster responses
* 🔄 Scales well with data

## 🧹 Example Code with LlamaIndex and Qdrant

```python
from llama_index.core import VectorStoreIndex, StorageContext
from llama_index.vector_stores.qdrant import QdrantVectorStore
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient

client = QdrantClient(path="./qdrant_data")

vector_store = QdrantVectorStore(
    "my_collection", client=client, enable_hybrid=True, batch_size=20
)

storage_context = StorageContext.from_defaults(vector_store=vector_store)

index = VectorStoreIndex.from_documents(
    documents,
    storage_context=storage_context,
)
```

## 📌 Conclusion

By integrating smart ingestion, embeddings, Qdrant indexing, metadata filtering, prompt engineering, and agent orchestration, you can build a powerful RAG pipeline tailored for real-world AI applications.
