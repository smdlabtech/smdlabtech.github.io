Under what circumstances should we leave a path? When is it essential to finish what we've started? If I buy a bag of peanuts and have an allergic reaction, no one would blame me if I threw it away. If I end a relationship with a woman who hits me, no one would say I have a commitment problem. But if I step away from an apparently safe path because my soul has other ideas, am I fickle?

The truth is that no one else can know for sure the path we are here to take. It’s tempting to listen—many of us long for that omnipotent other—but unless they are true psychic intuitives, they can’t know. All others can know is their own truth, and if they have truly done the work to excavate it, they will have the good sense to know that they can’t actually know someone else’s. Only the soul knows the path it is here to walk. Since you are the only one living in your temple, only you can know its scriptures and interpretive structure.

At the heart of the struggle lie two very different ideas of success: those motivated by survival and those motivated by the soul. For survivalists, success is security, pragmatism, power over others. Success is the absence of material suffering, damn the soul's nourishment. It’s a strange and ironic thing that most of the material power in our world often resides in the hands of younger souls. Still working in the egoic and material realms, they enjoy the sensations of power and focus most of their energy on accumulation. Older souls tend not to be as materially driven. They’ve already played the worldly game in past lives and they seek more subtle nuances of meaning in this one—authentication rather than accumulation. They are often ignored by the culture at large, although they are truly the most genuine warriors.

A soulful notion of success rests on the actualization of our innate image. Success is simply the completion of a soul’s stage, however unglamorous it may be. We have finished what we started when the lesson is learned. What a fear-based culture calls a wonderful opportunity may be fruitless and unwise for the soul. Staying in a passionless relationship may satisfy our need for comfort, but it can suffocate the soul. Becoming a famous lawyer is only worth it if the soul demands it. It’s an essential failure if you are called to be a monk this time around. If you need to explore and abandon ten careers in order to stretch your soul towards its innate image, then so be it. Fake it till you make it
