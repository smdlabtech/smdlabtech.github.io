### Data Visualization (Dataviz)

<p style="text-align: justify;"> 
Data visualization, commonly referred to as "dataviz," is the practice of graphically representing complex data sets to enhance their comprehension and analysis. Bridging the gap between graphic design and statistical analysis, dataviz turns numbers and raw information into visual illustrations such as charts, maps, diagrams, and infographics.

The primary goal of data visualization is to communicate information clearly and efficiently to its audience, regardless of the volume or complexity of the data being handled. By highlighting trends, correlations, and patterns, dataviz enables observers to gain insights that would otherwise be difficult to extract or understand from spreadsheets or textual reports.

With the rise of big data, dataviz has become an essential tool across many fields, from business intelligence to scientific research, and from public health to education. It plays a crucial role in data-driven decision-making and data storytelling.
