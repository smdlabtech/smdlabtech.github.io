## What is Generative AI?

Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, including text, images, audio, video, and code. These systems learn from vast amounts of data to generate original outputs that are often indistinguishable from human-created content.

Key characteristics:
- Content creation capabilities
- Context understanding
- Multi-modal generation
- Continuous learning

## Key Applications
